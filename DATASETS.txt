National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials

The NIH Clinical Trials dataset contains publicly and privately supported clinical studies on a wide range of diseases and conditions. 

From this dataset, we hope to analyze data in order to find any discrepancies in areas related to safety, successful trials, failed trials, successful locations, location popularity, and collaborators. The main dataset that of the collection is the Clinical Studies Main, which is what we believe will be the best dataset to compare to others. In the clinical results dataset, an interesting attribute to analyze relationships with would be the higher percentage of secondary trial types. In the collaborator dataset, we want to see if there are any specific collaborators that have more success than others and try to figure out if there are any particular reasons of interest. As for interventions, and interesting feature to look into is the type of intervention, whether it be drug, biological, behavioral, or other in order to see if there is a correlation elsewhere. Another data point of interest would be location and whether or not there are more favorable locations with better clinical outcomes than others. 

Datasets: Arm Groups, Clinical Results, Clinical Studies Main, Collaborators, Contacts, Interventions, Location Countries, Locations, Other Outcomes, Primary Outcomes, References, Removed Trials Location Countries, Responsible Parties, Results Reference, Secondary Outcomes

The dataset's most notable primary key is the nct_number feature, specifically in the "Clinical Studies Main" dataset, which would contain a foreign key in the rest of the datasets.

NCT01281644	Primary	Difference in Disease Severity Scores	The primary outcome measure was the difference in disease severity total score, combining redness and roughness/bumpiness scales, between the treated site and the control site, as rated by the blinded dermatologists at 12 weeks post-initial visit. These scales were not validated, as no relevant validated scale was available. However, raters were trained and calibrated on the use of the scale, and prior to review of study images, were asked to rate archival skin images on the same 4-point qualitative subscales used in the study. Each scale ranged from 0 to 3, with 0 being none and 3 being severe. The total score summed the redness and roughness/bumpiness scale scores for a range of 0 (none/better outcome) to 6 (severe/worse outcome).	12 weeks
NCT01281644	Secondary	Patient Self-rated Severity	This outcome measure was the difference in disease severity total score, combining redness and roughness/bumpiness scales, between the treated site and the control site, as rated by the patient at 12 weeks post-initial visit. These scales were not validated, as no relevant validated scale was available. Each scale ranged from 0 to 3, with 0 being none and 3 being severe. The total score summed the redness and roughness/bumpiness scale scores for a range of 0 (none/better outcome) to 6 (severe/worse outcome).	12 weeks
NCT00818662	Primary	Change From Baseline at 18 Months in the Alzheimer´s Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)	The ADAS-Cog is a validated psychometric instrument that evaluates memory (word recall, word recognition), attention, reasoning (following commands), language (naming, comprehension), orientation, ideational praxis (placing letter in envelope) and constructional praxis (copying geometric designs). This test was administered by experienced raters certified by Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at each site.
Scores on the ADAS-Cog range from 0-70 with higher scores indicating greater impairment; hence increases from baseline reflect potential cognitive deterioration.	Baseline & 18 months
NCT00818662	Primary	Change From Baseline at 18 Months in Alzheimer´s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL)	The ADCS-ADL scale is a validated tool to assess instrumental and basic activities of daily living based on a 23 item structured interview of the caregiver or qualified study partner.
Scores on the ADCS-ADL range from 0-78 with lower scores indicating greater impairment; hence decreases from baseline reflect potential functional deterioration.	Baseline & 18 Months
NCT00818662	Secondary	Change From Baseline at 9 Months in the Alzheimer´s Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)	The ADAS-Cog is a validated psychometric instrument that evaluates memory (word recall, word recognition), attention, reasoning (following commands), language (naming, comprehension), orientation, ideational praxis (placing letter in envelope) and constructional praxis (copying geometric designs). This test was administered by experienced raters certified by Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at each site.
Scores on the ADAS-Cog range from 0-70 with higher scores indicating greater impairment; hence increases from baseline reflect potential cognitive deterioration.	Baseline & 9 months

AERO Data Lab - National Institute of Health, Clinical Trials 

The NIH Clinical Trials dataset contains publicly and privately supported clinical studies on a wide range of diseases and conditions. The AERO Bird's Eye Dataset takes a collection of these NIH Clinical Trials and looks at big companies that are oversaturating research in certain areas instead of spreading out their research into areas that have not been researched much. 

From this dataset, we want to analyze it and compare it to the NIH Clinical Trials to find some sort of correlation between factors that affect big companies from spreading out into underresearched diseases. 

The dataset's most notable primary key is the nct_number feature, which is a perfect primary key to match with our primary dataset.
